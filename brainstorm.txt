The channels will be saved in the user configuration folder (~/.config/homerunner/channels)
The filename for each channel file will be the hex id of the device that the channels correspond to.

A configuration file specifying other parameters about the plugin will be saved in the user configuration folder (~/.config/homerunner/)

The schema file will be in the same directory as the homerunner plugin (~/.local/totem/plugins/homerunner)


How to set selected device for playback
-- Combobox triggers changed signal inside channel_list
-- (changed) Signal triggers handler inside channel_list
--- (on_changed) Handler inside widget calls combo_box_get_active_device_id
--- (selected_device) Signal is emitted with a char* device_id

---- Since pretty much any device model can be provided to the channel_list, channel_list should make a virtual method available that allows the programmer to determine how to render the display text using the model provided.


----- (on_set_device) Handler inside plugin uses manager to set device using device_id
----- get_tuner_from_device is used to get a free tuner
----- Sets private variable to device with free tuner

How to set channels for selected device

-- (changed) Signal triggers handler inside widget

---- (on_changed) Handler inside widget calls combo_box_get_active_iter
---- (selected) Signal is emitted with active_iter

------ (on_selected_set_channels) Handler inside plugin uses manager to get device using active iter
------ (There need to be _get_channel_model and _get_device_model methods for channel_list)
------call _get_channels_for_device


_get_channels_for_device
-- if channels.xml file exists for device number, convert it to a liststore and load it
-- otherwise
--- scan channels
--- display message indicating that scan is busy




It's not a good idea to have multiple manager objects each managing 1 playback and N recordings.
Each manager wouldn't be aware of what the other manager was recording. If UI was tied to a manager,
when I switched between managers, the recording status of a channel might disappear depending on which
manager was active.
I should instead have an object that manages playback, an object that manages channel scanning,
and an object that manages recording.
